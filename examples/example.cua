    Booleans will be different in CUA.
    I want a boolean to be lower level.

    Booleans won't just prove 'true' or 'false' in our language, it will work with low level bit operations.
    In CUA, I want to add a keyword 'bit' for low level working with bits.
    With the keyword 'bit', you can then assign a boolean value.
    I will make it to where our runtime turns that 'boolean' into a true or false mechanism.
